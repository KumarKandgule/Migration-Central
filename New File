|  After the E3\.3 Build routine, the application may be running on both on\-premise and AWS\. This routine's purpose is to do basic validations against AWS\-hosted application to make sure the application is up and running as expected and is ready for integration\. Depending on the migration methods, the on\-premise and AWS\-hosted application may either be run in isolation or run in synchronized fashion\. Do quick and basic validations in 15\+ minutes such as:   configuration change   volumes are well attached   check replication running, if replication is needed   connectivity   exercise the migration multiple times, until basic validation passed\.      |
