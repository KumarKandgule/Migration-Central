# Migration Central : First Time User


## Welcome !

AWS Migration Central is your gateway to everything Migration - Migration Best Practices, tutorials, How-to's, Tools, migration patterns, Tutorials, use cases, escalations for additional support, and a lot more.

There are two easy ways to get started with the toolkit : **Top Navigation Menu** or **Search** (top right corner). Some menus provide second-level navigation options, so if you know what you are looking for you can get to them in one click. If you are unsure you can always start at the top-level menu and drill down for more information - it's that easy.

Let's dive into more details on each Menu item to give you more insights.

Migrations is a good place to start if you are a new user. This section covers the three broad phases under Migration, starting with Assessment:

1.  **Assessment** - If you want to figure out where does an organization stand in it's overall readiness for migrating to AWS, you start with assessment. This stage is also called **Migration Readiness and Assessment (MRA)**. It dives into details on how-to conduct assessment, templates/tools to use, and how to summarize the findings for the customer. You can use the output from the assessment to generate SOW deliverables.

2.  **Readiness and Planning** - After you have assessed the readiness (conducted MRA) and signed the SOW, time to move some apps to AWS. This section dives deep into the 8 work streams under **Migration Readiness and Planning (MRP)**. After conducting this phase successfully, you will lay down the foundation for customer to migrate workloads to AWS at scale.

3.  **Migration-at-scale** - After the foundation in Security, Operational Integration, Organizational Changes, Program Management are laid out by migrating a few applications to AWS in a Landing Zone that is well architected and compliant (with customer requirements), it's time to move 1000s of applications using our Migration Factory. Migration-at-scale covers detail on how to use MRP fundamentals to scale to 1000s of applications.

MRA and work streams within MRP follow the same format to organize content. For each work stream, there are basically 5 pages.
