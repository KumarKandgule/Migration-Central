# Migration Central : First Time User

Created by Sindhu, PJ, last modified on Mar 12, 2018

## Welcome !

AWS Migration Central is your gateway to everything Migration - Migration Best Practices, tutorials, How-to's, Tools, migration patterns, Tutorials, use cases, escalations for additional support, and a lot more.

There are two easy ways to get started with the toolkit : **Top Navigation Menu** or **Search** (top right corner). Some menus provide second-level navigation options, so if you know what you are looking for you can get to them in one click. If you are unsure you can always start at the top-level menu and drill down for more information - it's that easy.

Let's dive into more details on each Menu item to give you more insights.

Migrations is a good place to start if you are a new user. This section covers the three broad phases under Migration, starting with Assessment:

<div class="orderedlist">

1.  **Assessment** - If you want to figure out where does an organization stand in it's overall readiness for migrating to AWS, you start with assessment. This stage is also called **Migration Readiness and Assessment (MRA)**. It dives into details on how-to conduct assessment, templates/tools to use, and how to summarize the findings for the customer. You can use the output from the assessment to generate SOW deliverables.

2.  **Readiness and Planning** - After you have assessed the readiness (conducted MRA) and signed the SOW, time to move some apps to AWS. This section dives deep into the 8 work streams under **Migration Readiness and Planning (MRP)**. After conducting this phase successfully, you will lay down the foundation for customer to migrate workloads to AWS at scale.

3.  **Migration-at-scale** - After the foundation in Security, Operational Integration, Organizational Changes, Program Management are laid out by migrating a few applications to AWS in a Landing Zone that is well architected and compliant (with customer requirements), it's time to move 1000s of applications using our Migration Factory. Migration-at-scale covers detail on how to use MRP fundamentals to scale to 1000s of applications.

MRA and work streams within MRP follow the same format to organize content. For each work stream, there are basically 5 pages.

<div class="itemizedlist">

*   **Landing page:** This is the second level navigation from the top-right menu. You will find 8 of them under "Readiness and Planning" under Migrations. This page outlines the different sections for work streams - it's basically a teaser into the detailed topics.

*   **How-to page**: This page dives into how to conduct the work stream. It helps you answer questions like:

    <div class="itemizedlist">

    *   What do I need to begin work? When do I begin work?

    *   What are the tasks I need to carry out? Any sequencing concerns?

    *   What are the dependencies with other work streams?

    </div>

</div>

How-to is divided into three broad areas:

<div class="itemizedlist">

*   <div class="itemizedlist">

    *   **Discovery (of current state)**: What tasks need to be carried out to understand the current state?

    *   **Design (of target state)**: What tasks to complete to understand the design of target state in AWS?

    *   **Build and Validate (EPICs to execute):** What tasks to carry out to get the customer from current to future state.

    </div>

*   **Deliverables**: This page contains documents, templates, and questionnaires that have to be delivered to the customer. Examples include: excel template for calculating TCO, MRP kickoff powerpoint, etc. If you are looking for any document for training customers can be found under References section.

*   **References & Help:** This page contains references in the form of links, case studies, blogs, videos, and anything that can help you ramp up on the domain covered in work stream.

*   **FAQs & Feedback:** This page contains question and answers related to the work stream and three ways for providing feedback to Migration Speciality team.

Tools are required for all phases of migration from assessment to migrations-at-scale. This new section dives into the various tools available under Partner Tools and AWS Tools. This is the place to find what tools to use for which phase, pros and cons of each tool, licensing requirements for partner tools, feedback from colleages, use cases, etc.
